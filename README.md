The game **'Trümmerfrauen'** was created for the [Global Game Jam 2020](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/women-debris-1) with the topic *'Repair'*. 
It is a co-op game for two players where you can experience what it feels like to repair and rebuild your home after a long war. In remembrance of the many women *('Trümmerfrauen')*, who helped rebuild the country for their children, families and future generations.

The players need to work together to clean a destroyed world, salvage what they can from the ruins and process the debris into reusable resources to rebuild infrastructure and buildings. Each building that is constructed serves a purpose and helps the players to either achieve buffs *(e.g. movement speed)* or provide necessary infrastructure to produce advanced resources. A 'recipe' of the necessary resources is located at each construction site to show the players which resources they need to salvage.
